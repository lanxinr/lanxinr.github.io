## Introduction

I am a graduate student in Instructional Design, Development & Evaluation at Syracuse University, with a passion for inclusive and practice-oriented instructional design. My research focuses on connecting farm-based experiential learning with multilingual student engagement, and exploring cultural and AI-integrated pedagogy in heritage language education.

With over two decades of professional experience in corporate training, program design, and cross-sector collaboration, I bring a unique perspective to educational research. My work spans from designing nationwide training programs in eldercare and health services to teaching heritage Chinese learners, always with a focus on creating meaningful, accessible learning experiences.
