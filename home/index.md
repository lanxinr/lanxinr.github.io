## Comparison Table

| Learning Theory | What is Learning? | How Learning Occurs? |
|----------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| **Behaviorism** | • Learning is defined as "a change in observable behavior."<br>• Equipotentiality: organisms learn similarly. | • Stimulus → Response conditioning.<br>• Reinforcement (positive/negative) strengthens behavior.<br>• Removing distractions to support S-R formation. |
| **Cognitivism** | • Learning is defined as "change in mental structures(schema)."<br>• Assimilation & Accommodation. | • Information processing (attention → encoding → retrieval).<br>• Schema construction & meaningful organization.<br>• Use of prior knowledge. |
| **Social Learning Theory** | • Learning is defined as "constructing behavior patterns society expects."<br>• Through interaction with environment & people. | • Reciprocal causation (B-E-P affect each other).<br>• Modeling (observing others).<br>• Vicarious reinforcement & social interaction. |
