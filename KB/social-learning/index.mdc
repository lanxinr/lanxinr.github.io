In an art class, the teacher stands beside the front table while 22 students sit in pairs at their benches. On the interactive whiteboard behind her, a picture of three girls dancing gracefully under rainbow-colored lights is displayed. The beams reflect like sparkles on water. She taps the screen gently and asks, "Can anyone tell me what kind of feeling this picture gives you?" Little hands shoot up. "It looks magical!" says one student. Another adds, "It feels like a dream." The teacher smiles and nods, saying, "Exactly. That's the power of color and movement in art."

She then holds up three strips of tissue paper—red, blue, and yellow—and explains, "Today, we are going to create our own rainbow light effect by layering tissue paper. Imagine your dancers moving under the lights you design." Students eagerly begin cutting and arranging tissue paper. Some whisper ideas to each other, while others work silently, absorbed in their designs. The classroom hums with the rustling of paper and soft conversations.

As the activity continues, the teacher stops to encourage a shy student, kneels to help another reposition a tricky layer, and praises one group for blending colors into a glowing sunset effect. Near the end, she invites everyone to place their collages on the display board titled "Dancing with Light." Students gather around, pointing and admiring. Excited voices say, "It looks like they're all dancing together on one big stage." Smiling, the teacher concludes by summarizing the class's creative outcomes.

## Reflection

Learning Social Learning Theory (SLT) over the past few weeks has been a very gradual process for me. At first, it felt familiar: "people learn by observing, imitating, and interacting." But I didn't fully understand how these ideas connect with classroom decisions, instructional design, or my own learning. Through reading Bandura, watching the course videos, creating the shared scenario for all three theories, and building the KB products, my thinking started to shift. I realized that SLT is not just "learning happens in interaction." It is a framework that truly connects environment, behavior, and personal cognition.

The idea of reciprocal causation made the biggest impact on me. It reminded me of something I learned earlier in a parenting-coach certification program in China: "A child is the mirror of the parent." When a child struggles, parents need to ask whether the environment provides enough modeling, enough social support, and enough chances for success. While marking up my learning scenario with labels like self-efficacy, vicarious reinforcement, and guided participation, I suddenly saw that these mechanisms have always existed in my past professional experiences and even in my parenting, but I had never viewed them through SLT before.

### 1. My strongest connection: self-efficacy and learning through modeling

The SLT concept that resonates with me the most is self-efficacy. It brought back many memories from my years managing a training team in China. Several new colleagues were fresh graduates, and they were terrified when they first had to teach a demo lesson. At the time, I didn't think about theory; I simply showed them "how I would do it," asked them to mimic the structure, and then stood beside them offering small prompts like eye contact, pacing, pausing. Later, I let them lead larger sections while I only stepped in when needed.

Looking back now, I see clearly: That was cognitive apprenticeship. And their progress came mainly from growing self-efficacy through supported practice. I only understood this after working through the SLT infographic and naming the strategies. Realizing that I had unknowingly been using SLT ideas for years was a meaningful moment for me.

### 2. Social learning in real life: watching my daughter grow

As a mother of three, I also see SLT play out in my children's classroom experiences. When my oldest daughter first entered an American high school, she was very anxious about her English. But one of her classmates often raised her hand and spoke confidently. My daughter watched quietly for a few days and then said to me, "If she dares to try, maybe I can try too." That is vicarious reinforcement in the most natural form. The teacher would give my daughter simple feedback like "Great work!" and that was enough. Small social interactions like these slowly built her confidence. As I studied SLT, these real-life experiences helped me understand the theory at a deeper, more emotional level.

### 3. Challenges while completing the assignments

Working on the SLT infographic and the SLT-inspired instructional design infographic was not easy for me. I faced two challenges:

**(1) Turning theory into observable classroom behaviors**

Teacher modeling, peer collaboration, and positive reinforcement sound simple. But describing them as instructional strategies requires precision. I had to keep asking myself: "Is this SLT, or is it actually Cognitivism?" "Does this activity rely on social interaction, or is it only individual processing?" This back-and-forth helped me truly see the difference between theories.

**(2) Making sure my example matched SLT rather than other theories**

For instance, when I chose Reciprocal Teaching, I needed to ensure it wasn't merely repeated practice (Behaviorism) or just a set of cognitive reading strategies (Cognitivism). It had to include shared meaning-making and social dialogue. This required a lot of revision and comparison across theories. Although challenging, this process deepened my understanding far more than reading alone.

### 4. How SLT reshaped my view of instructional design

This course helped me recognize that a strong learning activity depends not only on content, but on the social structure around it: Is there a clear model to observe? Are peers reinforcing one another? Do students have opportunities to take on more responsibility over time? Do learners see "If others can do it, maybe I can too"? These ideas were scattered in my previous experiences, but SLT organizes them into a coherent system. I also appreciate how Rob structures our IDE621 and IDE631 classes—modeling analysis, guiding us step by step, and then having us apply ideas in groups. When I teach Chinese to second graders on weekends, I now intentionally design lessons with "model → practice → collaboration → reflection," rather than relying mainly on explanation and worksheets.

### 5. My questions and limits I see in SLT

Even though I strongly value SLT, I also noticed some limits, especially in my own graduate-level learning. Some tasks—such as academic writing, coding, or reading theoretical articles—are highly individual. Observation and social interaction are not always the central mechanisms. In addition, cultural contexts shape social interaction in very different ways. Team collaboration in my past work environment in China feels very different from classroom collaboration in the U.S. This makes me aware that SLT may behave differently across cultural settings. Still, these observations do not reduce my appreciation for SLT. Instead, they remind me that no single theory explains all learning. SLT's strength lies in helping people enter new domains, build confidence, and create shared meaning. That makes it especially important in teaching, training, and parent–child learning.

Studying SLT has helped me connect the theory with my real life, think more carefully about what I'm doing, and understand it better by using it.
