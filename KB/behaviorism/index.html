                    <p>In an art class, the teacher stands beside the front table while 22 students sit in pairs at their benches. On the interactive whiteboard behind her, <span class="color-bright-yellow">a picture of three girls dancing gracefully under rainbow-colored lights is displayed. </span>The beams reflect like sparkles on water. She taps the screen gently and asks, "Can anyone tell me what kind of feeling this picture gives you?" Little hands shoot up. "It looks magical!" says one student. Another adds, "It feels like a dream." The teacher smiles and nods, saying, "Exactly. That's the power of color and movement in art." She then holds up three strips of tissue paper—red, blue, and yellow—and explains, "Today, we are going to create our own rainbow light effect by layering tissue paper. Imagine your dancers moving under the lights you design." Students eagerly begin cutting and arranging tissue paper. Some whisper ideas to each other, while others work silently, absorbed in their designs. The classroom hums with the rustling of paper and soft conversations. As the activity continues, the teacher stops to encourage a shy student, kneels to help another reposition a tricky layer, and praises one group for blending colors into a glowing sunset effect. Near the end, she invites everyone to place their collages on the display board titled "Dancing with Light." Students gather around, pointing and admiring. Excited voices say, "It looks like they're all dancing together on one big stage." Smiling, the teacher concludes by summarizing the class's creative outcomes.</p>

        <!-- Reflection -->
        <section class="section">
            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <p>Studying behaviorism again at this stage of my academic journey feels both familiar and refreshing. Much of my professional career before joining the IDDE program was devoted to designing and managing large-scale corporate training. In those contexts, I often relied on strategies that, looking back now, align closely with behaviorist principles. Breaking complex skills into smaller, observable tasks, offering timely feedback, and using structured practice were part of my daily work, even though I did not always name them as "shaping" or "reinforcement."</p>
            <p>My recent coursework and projects have allowed me to revisit behaviorism with new eyes. In Seeds of Story, for example, I observed how young learners responded when their actions were reinforced with encouragement or with visible results like the display of their work. The sequence of activities—preparing the soil, planting seeds, documenting growth with iPads, and presenting their findings—was in many ways a chain of behaviors, each step serving as a cue for the next. Seeing how small reinforcements built confidence reminded me that observable progress can be as powerful as abstract explanation, especially for students who are just beginning to explore STEM.</p>
            <p>Writing about learning theories in my recent papers also pushed me to reflect on my own habits as a learner. I noticed that I respond well to frequent low-stakes quizzes and clear criteria for success. These simple tools reduce distractions and give me tangible evidence of progress. At times they feel mechanical, yet they help me stay on track in the middle of a demanding graduate schedule. It makes me appreciate why programmed instruction and criterion-referenced design, though rooted in behaviorism, remain influential in instructional development today.</p>
            <p>Of course, I am also aware of behaviorism's limits. In corporate projects and now in educational research, I have seen how motivation, identity, and culture shape learning in ways that reinforcement alone cannot explain. Still, I find value in remembering that every theory highlights one side of a complex process. For me, behaviorism serves as a reminder to pay attention to what learners actually do, to design learning in steps that can be practiced, and to provide reinforcement that is both immediate and meaningful.</p>
